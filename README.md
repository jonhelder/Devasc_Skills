Task2: Ansible
Task Preparation: Had to run both VM's on one PC. Copy the hosts ans ansible config file to the Devasc_Skills directory
Task Implemetation: created the file ios_status.yaml
Task trouble: on both my PC's (Desktop-4GB ans LAPtop-GB) I was not able to run both VM's at the same time. 
Only when I reduce the required RAM of te DEVASC-VM to 2GB and the CRS1000 to 3GB I was able to run both.
